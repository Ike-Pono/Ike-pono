## Issues and pull requests

While having good documentation is certainly important to help onboard new people including users and contributors of all kinds, there is a lot to do at the moment in terms of design and implementation, and editing documentation is something that seems best to be done when you are reading or learning about something, using something, building upon something, etc., not usually just for the sake of reading and editing for other users, although reviewing one's own writing is certainly a good practice.

## Contribution guidelines

### Introduction

For an introduction to GitHub wikis, see [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/).

### Fixing vandalism

If you notice that a page is vandalized, such as the footer (which has been frequently vandalized), this home page, or the sidebar, please view the page history (which is the link of a page with a `/_history` appended), and revert to the last known good version (which are listed below for convenience for the above pages), by ticking it and the most recent revision, selecting "Compare revisions", and then "Revert changes":

#### Page titles

**Avoid changing the title of a page**, as the link for it will change. In particular, if you change the title for a page, any link to it will just direct to a blank page. (In the case of this page, also the Wiki tab in the header of this repo, as well as any link to the Home page, will just direct to a list of pages.) If you really want to change the title, then create a new page with the new title, move the contents of the old page to the new page, and update the old page with a redirect link to the new page. If you want to translate a page, create a new page and translate the original there. Consider previewing your changes before saving them, and if you detect any errors, fix them. If you happen to get directed to a page that doesn't exist with a prompt to create a new page, do that, without changing the title. Then check the history of the newly created page. It may be that there is a history of changes to the page that you just created, with the second most recent change (second to you creating the page) being that someone renamed the page. If so, please fix the page (restore it to the revision before the title was changed or redirect to the new page) and tag the person who renamed the page in this issue.

### Wikipedia pillars

Wikipedia has [five pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars) which provide a good standard for contributing that we can adapt for our needs. If you have experience with editing on Wikipedia, then that will help with knowing how to edit this wiki, although the contribution rules are less strict. Referencing facts is a key writing and proofreading task, as well as checking that information is up-to-date (and updating it if otherwise), correcting grammar, typos, and spelling; and making the wiki comprehensive and easy to understand. Other rules, such as a neutral point of view and no original research are desirable, but may be hard to maintain. Notability is less relevant, this wiki is about all things Ethereum.

### Translating
The title of the page should start with [Language]: title, e.g. "[German] White Paper" or "[中文] 以太坊Wiki目录". Then add a Table of Contents (ToC) page linking for the language, linking to all pages of that language, and add a link to it in the [footer]

### License and [contributor license agreement]

Please permit your contributions to be under the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) [[1](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)],  which makes your contributions have no rights reserved, putting them in the public domain. This will help to allow for the dissemination of information.

### Editing locally (requires access permission)

Users signed in with GitHub can edit and add pages using a [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally). 

If you change the headers of the page then it's a good idea to update the contents to reflect that change, using doctoc, but you will need to have access permissions to push changes to this repo; you could ask in https://gitter.im/ike-pono/open-world-movement, and if there's no response from anyone in the EF after a couple of days, you could ping @votetheblock.
